# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Week 2 Assignment** - AI/ML Fellowship

In this project I performed a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset to identify factors that influenced survival rates.

##  Overview
The goal is to apply **Data Cleaning**, **Preprocessing**, and **Visualization** techniques using Python libraries.

## Libraries Used
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.

## 📂 Key Insights
1.  **Females** had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
2.  **1st Class** passengers had better survival odds compared to 3rd Class.
3.  **Children** (Age < 10) were prioritized during the rescue.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Open the `Titanic_EDA_Analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2.  Run all cells to see the cleaning process and visualizations.
